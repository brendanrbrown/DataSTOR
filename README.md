Folder for staging datasets for stor155 class, at present ad-hoc

If time allows at the end of the semester I will organize these into a sqlite database and create a small package with a data frame based class with attributes to make finding appropriate datasets for different sections a bit easier, for keeping track of data vintage etc. It would also include methods to update the data and some other database related utilities. Would come with some R version as well.
